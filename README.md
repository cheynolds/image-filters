# simple-filters

Various image filters based on the SimpleImage Python Library. Developed during CIP-2021.


### RGB Filter
- This program implements an image filter by adjustments to RGB pixels.


### Fire-Watch-Filter
- This program highlights fires in an image by identifying pixels
whose red intensity is more than an intensity constant multiplied bythe
average of the red, green, and blue values at a pixel. Those
"sufficiently red" pixels are then highlighted in the image
and other pixels are turned grey, by setting the pixel red,
green, and blue values to be all the same average value.
